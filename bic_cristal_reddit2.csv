They created a new formula, which they use in the Crystal Xtra Smooths, the Roundstick Grip Ultra Comforts, the Atlantis/Glides, and of course the Velocities. Just replace all the bad ink and say that everything is now Xtra Smooth, cuz no one likes the slow, draggy, dull OG inks anymore, not a single person I know. I only kept the OG 4-Color stock for reference, but now that Ive done the comparison, Im gonna swap out the refills out for Zebra Z-Grips asap. Project B is going to be one of the newer style Bic 4-Color Grips. Im going to mix and match parts with a 4-Color Grip Pro, Grip Stylus, and possibly the grip 4&amp;1 to make the ultimate 4-Color Pro Grip Pro and then swap out the refills for Velocities.","BIC-Cristal"

I've used both in the medium and fine needle point sizes. The fine needle point size is a favorite of mine ==M for being able to write/draw lines almost as fine as a 0.38mm tip pen and still be very smooth, dark, crisp, and easy to control. The only needle point ball point pen that's better has nearly an identical cartridge, needle point, and capabilities is Office DEPOT's ADVANCED INK pens.","BIC-Cristal"

The OG 4 color refill is in my opinion the best all-around refills in the world, they may not be smooth, but they are just so reliable, they never skip on any paper, unlike jetstream refills which skip quiet a bit on coated papers. Bic OG refills works on all papers, in any situation, and they are the best for sketching.","BIC-Cristal"

"BIC-Cristal-e6e39ead9a646e6cf15594229d6c28d0",2023-02-05,"In my opinion, they must think that they can sell more by having multiple options. Some companies may not care about whether or not their employees have smoother writing pens so they buy in bulk and just order the pens a that are 5¢ cheaper per pen, reducing the cost of their bulk order. And for people or companies that do care about that, Bic can advertise/market their Xtra Smooth option at a small premium. I think its dumb, just use the new ink across all models and then find other ways to differentiate between the styles of pens, even reducing the need for some lines altogether. That way, instead of Crystals and Crystal Xtra Smooths, you can just sell the Crystals as the Classic pen with new smoother writing experience. But I guess thats just me. &lt;shrugs&gt;","BIC-Cristal"

My intention is to take the ink cartridges out of a BIC 4-Color 3+1 and replace them with black, blue, and red cartridges from Office DEPOT's ADVANCED INK pens (which are nearly identical to BIC's GLIDE fine needle point pens) because they offer more than black and blue. When it comes to ball pens I think I'll always prefer gel pens. However there are some paper types I use that gel pens will bleed through/show through too much. In those cases a ballpoint pen's services are employed.","BIC-Cristal"

And yeah, Ive pretty much bought, used, and reviewed every type of ballpoint pen on the market, not to mention gel, and rollerball, and lately fountain, and I can say, with confidence that the best ballpoint ink is between the Jetstream and Acroball with each having their own strengths and weaknesses. The Jetstream is the smoother of the two making it the smoothest of all ballpoints, but it does have a typical reddish/brown sheen, whereas the Acroball is just a hair less smooth , but it doesnt have the sheen, so it depends on if you prefer the color and lack of sheen or one step smoother + sheen.

The standard Vision is a fantastic rollerball. Way better than the standard Uniball Roller or the Deluxe, which is just a dressed up standard roller. The Vision Elite is indeed better, but only because it's smoother, otherwise, it lays the same lines and the only reason why it's smoother is because it uses a Tungsten Carbide ball at the point, which is the most scratch resistant metal known to man, which, when polishes, will make for the smoothest writing experience one can get using a pen that utilizes a ball and socket system at the tip for dispensing ink.

If you want a fountain pen, or in a lot of cases if you want to give someone a fountain pen, that will be perfect right out of the box - Montblanc. I have a Montblanc ballpoint, and its weighted nicely and balanced, but others can do that too. I have a Montblanc fineliner - a kind of cross between a marker and a rollerball, and it is a cool pen but others make those too. If you want to try a Montblanc fineliner, the refill fits in the Hongdian Black Forest rollerball pen. I also have a handful of vintage Montblanc fountain pens and they are kinda magic - I think thats where they get their reputation. The nibs offer effortless charm between thick and thin with a softness and bounciness that nothing else reliably has. Now for a nice rollerball, I love the studio neat mark one. I am quite partial to a nice ceracoat and the design has no seams. Its an excellent pen. For gels its tough, Sakura Craft Labs makes one called the 008 thats quite elegant and is one of my favorites, but I like a very bold line. The kind you can get with an energel, so I end up using my tactile turn all copper side click. Its a helluva pen, and in case of a zombie apocalypse, it could be used for self defense.","BIC-Cristal"

Never had a BIC burst or leak yet. Experiences do vary though, but I can only speak for mine. It is hot (+40°C/+100°F) where I live, and I spend a bit of time outdoors in shade or in warehouses without AC. Somewhat active at work as well. I rely on it because I know it will write the moment it touches the paper and won't bleed through heavily, which is ideal for cheques, documents, and carbon copy vouchers. It also won't smudge as much as some other ballpoints on thermal paper receipts. The nibs don't wiggle either, like some others do. It is also ideal because of price and how easy it is to find one locally and internationally as well. They're usually made well, unlikely to encounter a batch with quality issues, but you have to be mindful how the shop stored them and the age. I've used BICs that were unused for years, I notice that after a rough start, the ink is darker and gloopier on the paper.","BIC-Cristal"

Not everyone desires the style of pen they have ended up with and prefer a drier feel with less drag, but if you want the most ""creamy"" Bic, that'd be the 1.6mm refills, and I think those are great.

There is a huge range of brands that make Parker-style g2 size refills. They come in a range of ink types. Most are nonpressurized. Pressurized refills use traditional ballpoint ink, which is the same ink used in bic pens, which is why they feel so similar. Pressurized refills are more expensive because they can be, and there are some extra steps in manufacturing over standard Parker-style g2. Ballpoints use oil-based ink. Traditional Ballpoint uses thick paste ink. They have more rolling resistance, stiction, and need more pressure. Hybrid Ballpoints use liquid ink that feels closer to a rollerball. Gel uses a thickened water-based ink. They tend to be smoother than other types. Most types of gel ink dry quickly and are less prone to smearing.","BIC-Cristal"

Every time I write with one, I am amazed with the precision engineering and manufacturing behind a writing instrument that costs less than $0.01 to make. So, I purchased BIC Cristal ReNew, a metal body version of the ubiquitous BIC Cristal. The barrel of this pen is metal with a matte finish that is slightly slipperier than an all-plastic Cristal. The cap is plastic. Ive heard laments about the cap being plastic, but a metal cap (unless it had a plastic or felt sleeve) would scratch the barrel. The dimensions are the same as the classic Cristal, but it weighs 0.5 oz (14 g), which is over 2x heavier. One disappointment: Refills from classic Cristal pens fit loosely in the Re'New and will easily slide out. I've tried Cristals manufactured in different years and they all fit loosely. On the other hand, two refills from BIC Round Stic pens fit like the Re'New stock refill. The Re'New comes with two additional refills, which fit perfectly, but I would have preferred the flexibility of using Cristal refills, like the fine and broad points. To the best of my knowledge, BIC USA has not offered this pen in the USA.","BIC-Cristal"

A metal cap would scratch and eventually remove the paint. Regarding the use of the cap on BIC Cristals in general: It is my understanding that the cap's only uses are to prevent the pen from making unintended marks, like clothes, and to protect the point assembly from damage. The oil-based ballpoint pen ink in Cristals is much slower to evaporate than a liquid or gel ink. Except in very hot conditions, it should remain usable for years.

Also had shiny blue writing along the side, ""cristal m"". I suspect most other versions in the Asia pacific shared that design with a subtle difference, the writing along the side being white instead maybe. There was a time in 2008 roughly where supplies deviated and we had a version on sale at outlets which simply said ""bic medium"" in white lettering- assembled from a different region. Another version appeared before the global product range redesign which introduced the ""xtra"" stuff, but which had the darker blue lids and plugs with a tan/cream plug colour, still using the thicker, clogging, darker old ink. Have to remember, Australia and Asia were very slow to get the ""easy glide"" option with the cheaper lines of bic pens- not until 2011 while the USA got them 6 years earlier at least. The most we had in 06 was the ""smoothie"" retractable, ""atlantis"" and the ultra round stic grips, and they were priced more as deluxe options. Also, the vivid ink that the round stic pens use, were and are used for cristals in UK and US- an indicator of that is the gold ""quality promise"" sticker on the packet- appearing on the round stic packets, and American bic cristal packets, Yet the sticker is absent on Asia-pacific stocked packets, because a different, less vivid, less fluid ink was used.","BIC-Cristal"

Here is the link to sign up: [https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/bic](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/bic) It's pretty straightforward. From now on, I'll just be keeping a box to toss any used up pens, gluesticks (glad to hear this one specifically mentioned in the program, as I regularly use gluesticks to seal envelopes and affix stamps), and markers into, until full, then I just print a shipping label. I hope you find this information as helpful as I did.","BIC-Cristal"

I have loads of them to keep going in all 4 colors.this particular model was made in France and has a slightly larger cap and the plug is more secure too. Many years ago the tip used to match the ink colour but they changed it to brown in 2003 or 2004 I think. Used to have the bic logo printed near the plug too. Bic did make the refillable model too when they sold them in bulk of 50 and 100. The older model had more girth in the barrel and the plastic was more smooth too where as I find the refillable models more sharp. I guess it's a cut-down in cost.

Papermate, pilot, bic, Hauser, Rorito. unomax, Reynolds, cello and Classmate are far better branded when it comes to actual daily usage, they have affordable pens that are good enough, the refills don't cost a lot and they just work! Hauser I believe sells a ballpoint pen (Hauser xo) that uses low-viscosity ink similar to the one in the Jetstream and it's 12 cents a piece. refills are barely 5-6 cents. the only thing that suffers is the build quality and if you're a regular user like me, that doesn't matter. I used to hoard millions of jetstreams and eyes until I just did the math and realised how inefficient they were. short ink life, high prices, and the same technology in other pens for a lower cost. at this point, it's better to treat uni as a luxury brand next to Parker, not a daily-use brand.","BIC-Cristal"

"BIC-Cristal-72ab52a941e36d5ceb83981d56120474",2023-08-16,"In my country, Papermate goes by the name Reynolds and BIC goes by the name Cello and they make the exact same models albeit with different names so here is my take: Reynolds (at least where I am) is a far more respected brand. My grandparents have been using Reynolds pens since their school days. Reynolds aka Papermate makes a larger variety of pens as compared to Cello aka BIC. However, Reynold's Biros leave a lot to be desired, their ballpoint series is really rough. I remember having severe wrist cramps using a Reynolds 045 (their most popular Biro) and the ink colour is so damn light that if you don't squeeze the pen, it barely leaves a scratch. The Papermate/Reynolds gel pens and rollerball pens are really good. The Reynolds Racer gel is probably the best pen for quick note-taking during a class and the Trimax (rollerball) is a really good option for exams. Papermate/Reynolds has a variety of writing instruments that suit everyone's needs. Want to quickly jot down notes in class? Try the Jiffy Gel Pen, Want to write without any wrist cramps? Try the Robomax or Trimax Roller series. For every purpose and need Papermate has a pen for you. Cello aka BIC is also really popular however it doesn't get as much respect as Papermate. BIC's gel and rollerball pens leave a LOT to be desired. (The butter flow rollerball absolutely SUCKS) and the Pointec gel pen feels like a glorified biro. BIC's biros are (in my opinion) far superior to their Papermate counterparts. The Cello Pinpoint (BIC Cristal) and Butterflow (low-viscosity hybrid ink) ballpoint are some of the smoothest biros I have ever used. They are really lightweight and produce a pretty dark line even with light pressure. They even sell some really fine tip biros (the Cello gripper is a whopping 0.5mm biro) that are good for people with tiny handwriting. BIC doesn't have that much variety as compared to Papermate and they sell some pretty bog-standard Biros and absolutely horrible gel pens/rollerball pens. Additionally, BIC isn't as hackneyed as Papermate in my country and most stationery stores don't recommend BIC pens unless you specifically ask for one. BIC's biros really outshine Papermate's wrist-cramp-inducing ballpoint pens in almost every way. TL;DR: Papermate is overall a better brand as they provide a huge variety of pens that suit every need of yours. Their biro series really lacks in comparison to BIC's ballpoint pens. BIC's gel and rollerball pens aren't very special and got nothing going for them however BIC's ballpoint pens are far superior to Papermate in every way possible. The BIC Cristal or Pinpoint (as they call it in my country) alone defeats the entire Papermate ballpoint lineup.","BIC-Cristal"

I have a Papermate Inkjoy Quatro 3-pack (ballpoint) and I think the lines on that are a little more consistent in value and boldness than Cristals. But the attraction of a Bic isn't in the line quality, it's the buttery feeling of the tip. Smooth but not slippery, and you can make it work on the worst papers imaginable. You don't really experience that when you go to hybrid or gel.","BIC-Cristal"
"BIC-Cristal-72ab52a941e36d5ceb83981d56120474",2023-05-28,"Not really sure why you're asking between Bic and Papermate. While they may have been two of the more recognized names in pens at one time, they aren't all that relevant anymore, at least not in terms of quality pens. They are more in the low-end, budget space than anything else. When it comes to ballpoints, it really depends on what you want, they both have a staircase of products from the cheapest at the bottom and improving as you go up, but where Bic starts off with the most plain Round Stick, Papermate offers a half-step improvement with their Write Bros. line, but then Bic takes it a half step up from that with the Bic Roundstick Ultra Grip, but then Papermate takes it up another notch with their Inkjoy line, which offers even better smoothness, saturation, and most importantly colors, Bic goes up a half step further with their Glide line, which is even smoother, but not as many colors. Then you get up to the Big boys, the Papermate Profile 1.4mm Broad, but then Bic has a 1.6mm Velocity. So when it comes to ballpoints, I'd say they're tied. With Gel pens, it's the same story. Bic Gelocity's are a hair smoother than the Papermate Inkjoy's, however, the Inkjoys are available in more colors. Again, in terms of Gel, they are tied as well.","BIC-Cristal"

I have a controversial opinion for this sub along those lines: The pilot better retractable ballpoint is better than the rotring 600. I have a rotring 600. It's nice. Heavy, feels like a well made object. The better retractable is just about the same shape, has a good clip, wont break if you drop it (yes, the rotring is metal, but the tip is thin brass and will bend even on the ballpoint version). The better retractable is maybe 5 times the price of a crystal at just about $1. They're refillable though, and 1/25th the price of a rotring. It has become my go to favorite of all the ballpoints. pretty smooth dark ink too. I do have a few that I stuck an acroball or zebra surari eq refill in for maximum smoothnicity. I like the fine black for drawing, medium blue for writing. Most underrated cheap pen if you ask me.","BIC-Cristal"

I got mine through Amazon. They write super consistently, are a dark ink that is easy to read by everyone and they are way smoother than ballpoint pens. Another fan favorite is Pentel EnerGel pens. I still use these when I want to add some color to my writing since I already have so many of them and the refills are so cheap. I like that you can get metal pen bodies for these and buy boxes of refills. I would recommend getting the .5 plastic body pen and see if they work for you and then if they do buy a Pentel EnerGel Alloy pen and the .5 refills in whatever color you want. The alloy pens usually come with a .7 refill which I think will be too thick for you, but the .5 refills fit perfectly in the alloy pen bodies. EnerGel also comes in .3 size which I like for writing small notes in the margins of notes, but the black .3 isn't dark enough for my normal writing plus I don't like my handwriting with such a thin line. If you want to try fountain pens again I recommend the Pilot Metropolitan with a fine nib or maybe a medium these have a round grip section so you can use whatever grip you like most and I have never had a problem with my high writing angle. You can get a con-40 which is a screw type converter to use whatever bottle ink you want or pilot ink cartridges. I recommend going with a con-40 and Diamine inks. Most Diamine inks do extremely well on cheaper paper, plus they are pretty cheap and there are a lot of different colors to choose from even if you are looking for a dark grey, black or blue color. My favorite is Earl Grey it is dark enough to be professional and easy to read, but isn't boring like a deep black can be. You can find writing samples of both the fine and medium nibs to make a good decision on which is right for you, also there are lots of ink reviews that will help you know if different inks dry fast, bleed through different kinds of paper or have any cool properties like shading, sheen or shimmering.","BIC-Cristal"

It is Parker-style, so you can try different inks. It also has a pencil version as well, so you can have a matching set. I got the Bauhaus coloring because it looks WAY better to me. If you want to be really wasteful and buy a pen you can love and worry about equally, I would highly recommend the **Montblanc** ballpoints. I have a **Starwalker** and one of the smaller ones. The Montblack refills are my absolute favorite ballpoint refills I have tried. I can write for a really long time with the Starwalker and it is super comfortable.

I have grown less fond of the Japanese disposable pens (Uni-Ball, Pilot, etc) but they are amazing writers as well. I think the Pelikan Jazz is really nice and cheap enough that there isn't much risk. The one thing that can still get expensive/wasteful is if you go down the refill rabbit hole! There are a ton of Parker g2 refills out there to try. I actually bought the Jazz because I wanted to try the Pelikan ballpoint refill and I realized it was almost the same price buying the whole pen (with the refill in it) as buying a separate refill!","BIC-Cristal"
"BIC-Cristal-637344ea58253130b12a01cf6160f5f8",2023-03-24,"So, I actually did a comparison of as many blue oil-based ballpoint inks in 1.0mm that I could find (the RSVP was the only 0.7mm, cuz that's all I had on hand) and put them to the test. Let me see if I can find a picture...[Here it is](https://imgur.com/a/2eiLMJ4) And forgive me, I forgot add Easy and Quink Flows to this (it was a quick roundup, shoot me). So, the first picture is just how it came out normally, however, when I edited the photo and turned up the brightness what it reveals is that when it comes to saturation: Uni Jetstream was obviously the winner, but we knew it was going to be due to it being a hybrid, however, of the non-hybrids, it seems that BIC Glide (surprisingly) and Pen &amp; Gear (also surprisingly) were two of the best as far as saturation goes. You can look at the curly line and see how much darker they are than the others. Now, you might see the ""Z"" which is for the Z-Grip and its saturation falls short of the top 2, however, what you can't see is just how smooth they are and that's the tradeoff you get with a Z-Grip, at least when it comes to the color blue. Aside from the Jetstream, which is the smoothest of all, but was really only there as a control, the Z-Grip was the smothest non-hybrid. So there's a bit of a tradeoff and decision to make. Do you sacrifice smoothness for a bit more saturation or vice versa. I, personally, enjoy the smootheness of a pen more than I do the saturation, unless the pen is so inconsistent that it's bothersome, but a Z-Grip is consistent enough that smoothness trumps the rest. That being said Zebra is actually much more saturated with other colors than they are with blue. Blue just isn't Zebra's strong suit when it comes to inks, they managed to kill it with their purple and magenta though, both smooth **and** saturated.","BIC-Cristal"
"BIC-Cristal-637344ea58253130b12a01cf6160f5f8",2023-03-24,"So, I actually redid the test, this time also adding in black ink ballpoints as well as adding in a smoothness score. I also added a few pictures of some of the other Zebra colors compared to INC 'Just Right' pens, which are just rebranded Z-Grips, just with slightly different grip pattern and metal clip, with all else the same, including the ink. The Z-Grip actually performed even better this time around. The one I used for the last test, may have been, not so much a dud, but one that just didn't work optimally.

You get 3 pens for a buck, the only problem is that they only make 5 colors;, green, teal, magenta, purple, and orange...that's it.

After a week with it, I think I'm pretty happy with the Acroball 1000. I tried out the schmidt easyflow 9000, and it writes a lot like the bic roundtips to be honest (which isnt necessarily bad - theyre very reliable and have 0 smudge factor) but I like the darker, crisper look of the Acroball ink. I think I would also need a shorter spring to get the EasyFlow to work well with my F701, so that's a point against it for now. On the other hand, I was able to swap the fills for the z grip and the F701 with just a small trim, and I do like how the z-grip refill writes. It's a black refill, but the feel of the tip is good, so I'll probably pick up a blue version. Thanks for the suggestion!","BIC-Cristal"

One suggestion would be a Parker Jotter. Its design is sleek, classy, and iconic, and its stock Quinkflow ballpoint refill might be to your liking. Another suggestion would be a Zebra F-701 which is another beautifully minimalist steel pen, though Id recommend replacing its stock refill with either a Fisher Space Pen refill or a Uni Power Tank Smart Series refill. They are pressurized ballpoint cartridges that will write slightly darker and thicker as you apply more pressure.","BIC-Cristal"

I've seen some of those on here and they do look really nice. I have to ask what you mean by pressurized ballpoint cartridge, though.","BIC-Cristal"
"BIC-Cristal-9122c3376ed6daab6cd6f64189efcc51",2024-05-03,"A pressurized refill looks like a typical metal refill, but the cartridge uses air pressure to help force the ink towards the tip. This is what allows pens like the Fisher Space Pen to be able to write in so many different environmental conditions and on so many different types of surfaces (wet, dry, glossy, etc), to write upside down, on vertical surfaces, under water, in space, and so forth. They also tend to last a lot longer than gel, rollerball, or even other ballpoint refills.","BIC-Cristal"
"BIC-Cristal-9122c3376ed6daab6cd6f64189efcc51",2024-05-03,"A quick refill 101 might be of help. Pen refills are named for the ink inside of them. Rollerballs use water-based liquid ink. They have a wet flow that needs less pressure and takes longer to dry. The longer dry time is more likely to smear if anything touches the wet ink. The paper choice has more effect on this type. Unless labeled as capless they need a cap to keep them from drying out. Ballpoints use oil-based ink. Classic Ballpoint uses thick paste ink. They have more rolling resistance and need more pressure. Hybrid Ballpoints use liquid ink that feels closer to a rollerball. Gel uses a thickened water-based ink. They tend to be smoother than other types. Most types of gel ink dry quickly and are less prone to smearing. Another category is Fineliners or micro felt-tipped pens/refills. Most use water-based liquid ink with a porous plastic or felt tip. They need almost zero pressure to write with. They can be very fragile and are damaged easily. They are available in Euro-type rollerball refill sizes for capped rollerball pens. They need a well-sealing cap to keep from drying out. These are usually the types of pens used to sign international treaties and bills into law. Highly recommend trying this type as they feel very different. Fountain pens. Best if you just look that up. It's a huge topic.","BIC-Cristal"

What happens is that the oil and water components will separate. So the water (which is most of the ink) will wash away, but the oil will stay.

A $50 pen does not write 250 times better than a $0.20 BIC Cristal. However, there are other factors that contribute to a pen's value, like manufacturing and materials, and aesthetic attributes (design, appearance, weight and balance, etc.). Is the iconic and functional design of the Lamy Safari worth the premium over the BIC Cristal? Based on sales, millions believe it is; and yet, many do not prize the design over the utilitarian Cristal. I think this is one reason pens are so interesting (and why r/pens is so popular). The value of the instrument is in the ~~eye~~ hand of the beholder. Only you can determine the combination of performance and aesthetics that makes a pen ""worth it"" for you.

Thats how the idea came about: why not use a ball-shaped metal nib for writing? This is how the pen was born. = László József Biro shared his idea with his brother György, a chemist, and together they began researching and experimenting to create a new type of pen based on this concept. Finally, they found the perfect combination: a viscous ink and a tip with a small ball that rotated freely, preventing the ink from drying out and controlling its flow. They presented their invention at the Budapest International Fair in 1931 and patented it in 1938, although they did not market it immediately. With the start of World War II, the brothers emigrated to Argentina, where they founded a company in a garage. Although they were initially unsuccessful due to the high cost of the product, they secured a contract with the British Air Force, which boosted their popularity. In 1943, they licensed their invention to Eversharp Faber in the United States for $2 million. In 1950, Marcel Bich acquired the rights and, on the recommendation of an advertising expert, dropped the h from his surname and founded the company BICGroup. In that year, they launched the first BIC Cristal, one of the most perfect designs ever created, of which more than 20 million units are sold every day around the world. Since 1953, more than 100 billion BIC Cristals have been manufactured, making it the best-selling pen of all time. Interesting. Idk how true it is but this was found on Facebook.","BIC-Cristal"

I must have lost the caps to most of the BICs I owned and was overjoyed when BIC introduced [the first Bic Clip](https://cdn.ios.net.au/processed/1500x1500/p/PNB1050_1.jpg) a really awkward click pen, but with no cap and I immediately switched and then they introduced [the now famous BIC clic](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JVuqWoH-L._AC_SL1000_.jpg) which looked like a normal pen and I switched because the old click would hang up and not work and the pen was sealed. Today the options are endless and IMO when Pilot introduced the gel pen that was a game changer and now people argue who has the best gel refill/pen Pilot, Pentel, Zebra, etc and who has the best hybrid ink. So most of the world has moved on from the old BIC.","BIC-Cristal"

But, most student, and offices still use the old BIC. At least, around where I live it is so. And I would go back to the old BIC too, if I were in that kind of environment.
