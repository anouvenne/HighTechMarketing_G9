The refills that came with mine have BIC's classic ink. I cannibalized the Xtra-Smooth refill from a BIC Round Stic (the Cristal version will work too) because it is smoother and the ink is darker. You may find, as I did, refills taken from Cristal and Round Stic pens are a bit loose in the Re'New. Here's a simple trick to make them fit securely: https://www.reddit.com/r/pens/comments/1295tkm/another\_hack\_to\_make\_bic\_cristal\_refills\_fit/. Hope you enjoy your Re'New.","BIC-Cristal"

Never had a BIC burst or leak yet. Experiences do vary though, but I can only speak for mine. It is hot (+40°C/+100°F) where I live, and I spend a bit of time outdoors in shade or in warehouses without AC. Somewhat active at work as well. I rely on it because I know it will write the moment it touches the paper and won't bleed through heavily, which is ideal for cheques, documents, and carbon copy vouchers. It also won't smudge as much as some other ballpoints on thermal paper receipts. The nibs don't wiggle either, like some others do. It is also ideal because of price and how easy it is to find one locally and internationally as well. They're usually made well, unlikely to encounter a batch with quality issues, but you have to be mindful how the shop stored them and the age. I've used BICs that were unused for years, I notice that after a rough start, the ink is darker and gloopier on the paper.","BIC-Cristal"

It's an amazing ballpoint pen that uses a smoother ""hybrid"" ink compared to the BIC Cristal. I like the 1.0 tip the best but the specific body that I'm thinking of does come in .7 as well. There are a million variations of the Jetstream pens but all of them use the same ink (except for the Lite Touch).

I got mine through Amazon. They write super consistently, are a dark ink that is easy to read by everyone and they are way smoother than ballpoint pens. Another fan favorite is Pentel EnerGel pens. I still use these when I want to add some color to my writing since I already have so many of them and the refills are so cheap. I like that you can get metal pen bodies for these and buy boxes of refills. I would recommend getting the .5 plastic body pen and see if they work for you and then if they do buy a Pentel EnerGel Alloy pen and the .5 refills in whatever color you want. The alloy pens usually come with a .7 refill which I think will be too thick for you, but the .5 refills fit perfectly in the alloy pen bodies. EnerGel also comes in .3 size which I like for writing small notes in the margins of notes, but the black .3 isn't dark enough for my normal writing plus I don't like my handwriting with such a thin line. If you want to try fountain pens again I recommend the Pilot Metropolitan with a fine nib or maybe a medium these have a round grip section so you can use whatever grip you like most and I have never had a problem with my high writing angle. You can get a con-40 which is a screw type converter to use whatever bottle ink you want or pilot ink cartridges. I recommend going with a con-40 and Diamine inks. Most Diamine inks do extremely well on cheaper paper, plus they are pretty cheap and there are a lot of different colors to choose from even if you are looking for a dark grey, black or blue color. My favorite is Earl Grey it is dark enough to be professional and easy to read, but isn't boring like a deep black can be.

This is what allows pens like the Fisher Space Pen to be able to write in so many different environmental conditions and on so many different types of surfaces (wet, dry, glossy, etc), to write upside down, on vertical surfaces, under water, in space, and so forth.

"BIC-Cristal-9122c3376ed6daab6cd6f64189efcc51",2024-05-03,"A quick refill 101 might be of help. Pen refills are named for the ink inside of them. Rollerballs use water-based liquid ink. They have a wet flow that needs less pressure and takes longer to dry. The longer dry time is more likely to smear if anything touches the wet ink. The paper choice has more effect on this type. Unless labeled as capless they need a cap to keep them from drying out. Ballpoints use oil-based ink. Classic Ballpoint uses thick paste ink. They have more rolling resistance and need more pressure. Hybrid Ballpoints use liquid ink that feels closer to a rollerball. Gel uses a thickened water-based ink. They tend to be smoother than other types. Most types of gel ink dry quickly and are less prone to smearing. Another category is Fineliners or micro felt-tipped pens/refills. Most use water-based liquid ink with a porous plastic or felt tip. They need almost zero pressure to write with. They can be very fragile and are damaged easily. They are available in Euro-type rollerball refill sizes for capped rollerball pens. They need a well-sealing cap to keep from drying out. These are usually the types of pens used to sign international treaties and bills into law. Highly recommend trying this type as they feel very different. Fountain pens. Best if you just look that up. It's a huge topic.","BIC-Cristal"

"BIC-Cristal-02adc31fc6b1650e3ab8c38f9c2fbc98",2023-03-31,"The short answer is yes. The longer answer is this: Long long ago in a galaxy far far away (known as France), Bich originated the Bic pen company. Back in those golden days all their pens were manufactured in France. These are the pens I grew up using in school, even when I went to school in India and they wrote just fine. Many years passed and Bic decided to start manufacturing their non-European market pens in other countries \[which shall remain nameless\]. The pens sold in Europe are still made in France but the US is stuck with ones made in said nameless countries and since then, IMO the quality of the cristal pens sold in the US has seriously gone downhill. That's why I started using the Bic Orange Fine pens which Bic stupidly discontinued (it's much harder to find the French-made cristals here because most online sellers say it's original cristals but then substitute the crappily made ones sold in the US. I had some luck finding the original cristals on an Amazon UK international webstore but otherwise it's too hard to find them now). I've basically given up on cristals for regular writing.

It is a Parker-style refill but the refill that comes with it is one of my favorite Parker-style refills I have used. My favorite to date is probably the Visconti ballpoint refill. There is also a Parker-style Jetstream refill that is almost everyone's favorite. I have tried the regular Jetstream and can confirm it is a great writer. I just haven't pulled the trigger on the Parker-style option. Another pen I have and like (but probably not in a work setting) is the **[Leuchtturm1917 Drehgriffel**](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/drehgriffel-nr-1-bauhaus-edition.html). I like the looks and simplicity. It is comfortable to write with but not my favorite to hold for too long (just pretty thin and dense). It doesn't have a clip, so it can roll. It is Parker-style, so you can try different inks. It also has a pencil version as well, so you can have a matching set. I got the Bauhaus coloring because it looks WAY better to me. If you want to be really wasteful and buy a pen you can love and worry about equally, I would highly recommend the **Montblanc** ballpoints. I have a **Starwalker** and one of the smaller ones. The Montblack refills are my absolute favorite ballpoint refills I have tried. I can write for a really long time with the Starwalker and it is super comfortable. There are no hotspots for me or anything. There are some knock-offs you can find on Ebay but they won't come with the real MB refills. You can order those separately though. One pen I hoped to love and really don't is the **Lamy 2000** ballpoint. The ink is not great at all and the clip digs into my hand when writing.

Let me see if I can find a picture...[Here it is](https://imgur.com/a/2eiLMJ4) And forgive me, I forgot add Easy and Quink Flows to this (it was a quick roundup, shoot me). So, the first picture is just how it came out normally, however, when I edited the photo and turned up the brightness what it reveals is that when it comes to saturation: Uni Jetstream was obviously the winner, but we knew it was going to be due to it being a hybrid, however, of the non-hybrids, it seems that BIC Glide (surprisingly) and Pen &amp; Gear (also surprisingly) were two of the best as far as saturation goes. You can look at the curly line and see how much darker they are than the others. Now, you might see the ""Z"" which is for the Z-Grip and its saturation falls short of the top 2, however, what you can't see is just how smooth they are and that's the tradeoff you get with a Z-Grip, at least when it comes to the color blue. Aside from the Jetstream, which is the smoothest of all, but was really only there as a control, the Z-Grip was the smothest non-hybrid. So there's a bit of a tradeoff and decision to make. Do you sacrifice smoothness for a bit more saturation or vice versa. I, personally, enjoy the smootheness of a pen more than I do the saturation, unless the pen is so inconsistent that it's bothersome, but a Z-Grip is consistent enough that smoothness trumps the rest. That being said Zebra is actually much more saturated with other colors than they are with blue. Blue just isn't Zebra's strong suit when it comes to inks, they managed to kill it with their purple and magenta though, both smooth **and** saturated.","BIC-Cristal"
