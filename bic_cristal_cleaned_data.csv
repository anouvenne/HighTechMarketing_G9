The Vision Elite is indeed better, but only because it's smoother, otherwise, it lays the same lines and the only reason why it's smoother is because it uses a Tungsten Carbide ball at the point, which is the most scratch resistant metal known to man, which, when polishes, will make for the smoothest writing experience one can get using a pen that utilizes a ball and socket system at the tip for dispensing ink. So they're actually relatively close, performance-wise, but yes, the smoothness is noticeably better with the Elite, but I wanted to know how that Bic feels in comparison.","eh dunno go quite far vision vision elite 0.8mm 0.5mm often compare back back literally write page page use one also compare vision needle sharpie roller pilot precise v5 always curious good can say standard vision fantastic rollerball way good standard uniball roller deluxe just dress standard roller vision elite indeed good smooth otherwise lay line reason smooth use tungsten carbide ball point scratch resistant metal know man polish make smooth write experience one can get use pen utilize ball socket system tip dispense ink actually relatively close performance-wise yes smoothness noticeably good elite want know bic feel comparison",0.351976622670945,0.103689668609393

There is a huge range of brands that make Parker-style g2 size refills. They come in a range of ink types. Most are nonpressurized. Pressurized refills use traditional ballpoint ink, which is the same ink used in bic pens, which is why they feel so similar. Pressurized refills are more expensive because they can be, and there are some extra steps in manufacturing over standard Parker-style g2. Ballpoints use oil-based ink. Traditional Ballpoint uses thick paste ink. They have more rolling resistance, stiction, and need more pressure. Hybrid Ballpoints use liquid ink that feels closer to a rollerball. Gel uses a thickened water-based ink. They tend to be smoother than other types. Most types of gel ink dry quickly and are less prone to smearing.","parker-style g2 refill go expensive bic refill make metal likely make small scale huge range brand make parker-style g2 size refill come range ink type nonpressurized pressurize refill use traditional ballpoint ink ink use bic pen feel similar pressurize refill expensive can extra step manufacture standard parker-style g2 ballpoint use oil-based ink traditional ballpoint use thick paste ink roll resistance stiction need pressure hybrid ballpoint use liquid ink feel close rollerball gel use thicken water-based ink tend smooth type type gel ink spin-dry quickly little prone smear",0.0290469448838823,0.101406832563614

"BIC_274","2023-03-17","Yeah, I paid over $10 for a single BIC pen. There are three camps on r/pens: those who like BIC Cristals, those who dont, and those who are indifferent.

So, I purchased BIC Cristal ReNew, a metal body version of the ubiquitous BIC Cristal. The barrel of this pen is metal with a matte finish that is slightly slipperier than an all-plastic Cristal. The cap is plastic. Ive heard laments about the cap being plastic, but a metal cap (unless it had a plastic or felt sleeve) would scratch the barrel. The dimensions are the same as the classic Cristal, but it weighs 0.5 oz (14 g), which is over 2x heavier. One disappointment: Refills from classic Cristal pens fit loosely in the Re'New and will easily slide out. I've tried Cristals manufactured in different years and they all fit loosely. On the other hand, two refills from BIC Round Stic pens fit like the Re'New stock refill. The Re'New comes with two additional refills, which fit perfectly, but I would have preferred the flexibility of using Cristal refills, like the fine and broad points. To the best of my knowledge, BIC USA has not offered this pen in the USA.","yes pay single bic pen three camp r pen like bic cristals don t indifferent every time write one amaze precision engineer manufacture behind write instrument cost little make purchase bic cristal re new metal body version ubiquitous bic cristal barrel pen metal matte finish slightly slippery all-plastic cristal cap plastic have hear lament cap plastic metal cap unless plastic feel sleeve scratch barrel dimension classic cristal weigh oz g 2x heavy one disappointment refill classic cristal pen fit loosely re'new easily slide try cristals manufacture different year fit loosely hand two refill bic round stic pen fit like re'new stock refill re'new come two additional refill fit perfectly prefer flexibility use cristal refill like fine broad point good knowledge bic usa offer pen usa",0.101947407021548,0.0976753638765587

A metal cap would scratch and eventually remove the paint. Regarding the use of the cap on BIC Cristals in general: It is my understanding that the cap's only uses are to prevent the pen from making unintended marks, like clothes, and to protect the point assembly from damage. The oil-based ballpoint pen ink in Cristals is much slower to evaporate than a liquid or gel ink. Except in very hot conditions, it should remain usable for years. Another fact: The purpose of the hole at the top of the cap is to allow air flow through if the cap is lodged in the throat.","regard plastic cap metal re'new plastic cap kind paint finish metal body pen metal cap scratch eventually remove paint regard use cap bic cristals general understand cap's use prevent pen make unintended mark like clothe protect point assembly damage oil-based ballpoint pen ink cristals much slow evaporate liquid gel ink except hot condition remain usable year another fact purpose hole top cap allow air flow cap lodge throat",0.0728083015514318,0.0953096642133791

Papermate, pilot, bic, Hauser, Rorito. unomax, Reynolds, cello and Classmate are far better branded when it comes to actual daily usage, they have affordable pens that are good enough, the refills don't cost a lot and they just work!

I used to hoard millions of jetstreams and eyes until I just did the math and realised how inefficient they were. short ink life, high prices, and the same technology in other pens for a lower cost. at this point, it's better to treat uni as a luxury brand next to Parker, not a daily-use brand.","mate single uni jetstream 11x cost regular bic pen live uni-ball's rollerball series great gel pen also good jetstream like putting port starboard attachment spatula cool 11x price normal ballpoint say aint worth mention fact single jetstream refill go single week one refill cost time price normal ballpoint sake hybrid ink rollerballs cool similar cheap alternative just smooth waterproof like robomax per usual uni-ball rollerball refill expensive rollerball pen first place factor uni-ball just japanese montblanc indictment uni though make fantastic quality pen reliable issue product really practical daily use unless jobless junkie spend time write random stuff papermate pilot bic hauser rorito unomax reynolds cello classmate far good brand come actual daily usage affordable pen good enough refill cost lot just work hauser believe sell ballpoint pen hauser xo use low-viscosity ink similar one jetstream cent piece refill barely 5-6 cent thing suffer build quality regular user like matter use hoard million jetstreams eye just math realise inefficient short ink life high price technology pen low cost point good treat uni luxury brand next parker daily-use brand",0.175028259254289,0.0976133560758695

"BIC_399","2023-08-16","In my country, Papermate goes by the name Reynolds and BIC goes by the name Cello and they make the exact same models albeit with different names so here is my take: Reynolds (at least where I am) is a far more respected brand. My grandparents have been using Reynolds pens since their school days. Reynolds aka Papermate makes a larger variety of pens as compared to Cello aka BIC. However, Reynold's Biros leave a lot to be desired, their ballpoint series is really rough. I remember having severe wrist cramps using a Reynolds 045 (their most popular Biro) and the ink colour is so damn light that if you don't squeeze the pen, it barely leaves a scratch. The Papermate/Reynolds gel pens and rollerball pens are really good. The Reynolds Racer gel is probably the best pen for quick note-taking during a class and the Trimax (rollerball) is a really good option for exams. Papermate/Reynolds has a variety of writing instruments that suit everyone's needs. Want to quickly jot down notes in class? Try the Jiffy Gel Pen, Want to write without any wrist cramps? Try the Robomax or Trimax Roller series. For every purpose and need Papermate has a pen for you. Cello aka BIC is also really popular however it doesn't get as much respect as Papermate. BIC's gel and rollerball pens leave a LOT to be desired. (The butter flow rollerball absolutely SUCKS) and the Pointec gel pen feels like a glorified biro. BIC's biros are (in my opinion) far superior to their Papermate counterparts. The Cello Pinpoint (BIC Cristal) and Butterflow (low-viscosity hybrid ink) ballpoint are some of the smoothest biros I have ever used. They are really lightweight and produce a pretty dark line even with light pressure. They even sell some really fine tip biros (the Cello gripper is a whopping 0.5mm biro) that are good for people with tiny handwriting. BIC doesn't have that much variety as compared to Papermate and they sell some pretty bog-standard Biros and absolutely horrible gel pens/rollerball pens. Additionally, BIC isn't as hackneyed as Papermate in my country and most stationery stores don't recommend BIC pens unless you specifically ask for one. BIC's biros really outshine Papermate's wrist-cramp-inducing ballpoint pens in almost every way. TL;DR: Papermate is overall a better brand as they provide a huge variety of pens that suit every need of yours. Their biro series really lacks in comparison to BIC's ballpoint pens. BIC's gel and rollerball pens aren't very special and got nothing going for them however BIC's ballpoint pens are far superior to Papermate in every way possible. The BIC Cristal or Pinpoint (as they call it in my country) alone defeats the entire Papermate ballpoint lineup.","country papermate go name reynolds bic go name cello make exact model albeit different name take reynolds less far respect brand grandparent use reynolds pen since school day reynolds aka papermate make large variety pen compare cello aka bic however reynold's biro leave lot desire ballpoint series really rough remember severe wrist cramp use reynolds popular biro ink colour damn light squeeze pen barely leave scratch papermate reynolds gel pen rollerball pen really good reynolds racer gel probably good pen quick note-taking class trimax rollerball really good option exam papermate reynolds variety write instrument suit everyone's need want quickly jot note class try jiffy gel pen want write without wrist cramp try robomax trimax roller series every purpose need papermate pen cello aka bic also really popular however get much respect papermate bic's gel rollerball pen leave lot desire butter flow rollerball absolutely suck pointec gel pen feel like glorify biro bic's biro opinion far superior papermate counterpart cello pinpoint bic cristal butterflow low-viscosity hybrid ink ballpoint smooth biro ever use really lightweight produce pretty dark line even light pressure even sell really fine tip biro cello gripper whopping 0.5mm biro good people tiny handwriting bic much variety compare papermate sell pretty bog-standard biro absolutely horrible gel pen rollerball pen additionally bic hackneyed papermate country stationery store recommend bic pen unless specifically ask one bic's biro really outshine papermate's wrist-cramp-inducing ballpoint pen almost every way tl dr papermate overall good brand provide huge variety pen suit every need biro series really lack comparison bic's ballpoint pen bic's gel rollerball pen special get nothing go however bic's ballpoint pen far superior papermate every way possible bic cristal pinpoint call country alone defeat entire papermate ballpoint lineup",0.116860038672451,0.0999961895685117

When it comes to ballpoints, it really depends on what you want, they both have a staircase of products from the cheapest at the bottom and improving as you go up, but where Bic starts off with the most plain Round Stick, Papermate offers a half-step improvement with their Write Bros. line, but then Bic takes it a half step up from that with the Bic Roundstick Ultra Grip, but then Papermate takes it up another notch with their Inkjoy line, which offers even better smoothness, saturation, and most importantly colors, Bic goes up a half step further with their Glide line, which is even smoother, but not as many colors.

"BIC_577","2024-09-09","I love the sharpie s-gel and they come in .5 and .38. the .5 is very easy to find at any store so start with that and if needed you can get the .38 size online. I got mine through Amazon. They write super consistently, are a dark ink that is easy to read by everyone and they are way smoother than ballpoint pens. Another fan favorite is Pentel EnerGel pens. I still use these when I want to add some color to my writing since I already have so many of them and the refills are so cheap. I like that you can get metal pen bodies for these and buy boxes of refills. I would recommend getting the .5 plastic body pen and see if they work for you and then if they do buy a Pentel EnerGel Alloy pen and the .5 refills in whatever color you want. The alloy pens usually come with a .7 refill which I think will be too thick for you, but the .5 refills fit perfectly in the alloy pen bodies. EnerGel also comes in .3 size which I like for writing small notes in the margins of notes, but the black .3 isn't dark enough for my normal writing plus I don't like my handwriting with such a thin line. If you want to try fountain pens again I recommend the Pilot Metropolitan with a fine nib or maybe a medium these have a round grip section so you can use whatever grip you like most and I have never had a problem with my high writing angle. You can get a con-40 which is a screw type converter to use whatever bottle ink you want or pilot ink cartridges. I recommend going with a con-40 and Diamine inks. Most Diamine inks do extremely well on cheaper paper, plus they are pretty cheap and there are a lot of different colors to choose from even if you are looking for a dark grey, black or blue color. My favorite is Earl Grey it is dark enough to be professional and easy to read, but isn't boring like a deep black can be. You can find writing samples of both the fine and medium nibs to make a good decision on which is right for you, also there are lots of ink reviews that will help you know if different inks dry fast, bleed through different kinds of paper or have any cool properties like shading, sheen or shimmering.","love sharpie s-gel come easy find store start need can get size online get mine amazon write super consistently dark ink easy read everyone way smooth ballpoint pen another fan favorite pentel energel pen still use want add color write since already many refill cheap like can get metal pen body buy box refill recommend get plastic body pen see work buy pentel energel alloy pen refill whatever color want alloy pen usually come refill think thick refill fit perfectly alloy pen body energel also come size like write small note margin note black dark enough normal write plus like handwriting thin line want try fountain pen recommend pilot metropolitan fine nib maybe medium round grip section can use whatever grip like never problem high write angle can get con-40 screw type converter use whatever bottle ink want pilot ink cartridge recommend go con-40 diamine ink diamine ink extremely good cheap paper plus pretty cheap lot different color choose even look dark grey black blue color favorite earl grey dark enough professional easy read bore like deep black can can find write sample fine medium nib make good decision right also lot ink review help know different ink spin-dry fast bleed different kind paper cool property like shade sheen shimmer",0.294404384840755,0.110087274729214

"BIC_607","2023-03-20","In your price range (but way under for a change!) I would recommend the **Pelikan Jazz**. https://a.co/d/amAn4aD I think this would be a great ""professional"" pen. It feels really solid, is very comfortable to use, has a wide range of refill options, and is cheap enough that if/when it gets lost, you just replace it. It is a Parker-style refill but the refill that comes with it is one of my favorite Parker-style refills I have used. My favorite to date is probably the Visconti ballpoint refill. There is also a Parker-style Jetstream refill that is almost everyone's favorite. I have tried the regular Jetstream and can confirm it is a great writer. I just haven't pulled the trigger on the Parker-style option. Another pen I have and like (but probably not in a work setting) is the **[Leuchtturm1917 Drehgriffel**](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/drehgriffel-nr-1-bauhaus-edition.html). I like the looks and simplicity. It is comfortable to write with but not my favorite to hold for too long (just pretty thin and dense). It doesn't have a clip, so it can roll. It is Parker-style, so you can try different inks. It also has a pencil version as well, so you can have a matching set. I got the Bauhaus coloring because it looks WAY better to me. If you want to be really wasteful and buy a pen you can love and worry about equally, I would highly recommend the **Montblanc** ballpoints. I have a **Starwalker** and one of the smaller ones. The Montblack refills are my absolute favorite ballpoint refills I have tried. I can write for a really long time with the Starwalker and it is super comfortable. There are no hotspots for me or anything. There are some knock-offs you can find on Ebay but they won't come with the real MB refills. You can order those separately though. One pen I hoped to love and really don't is the **Lamy 2000** ballpoint. The ink is not great at all and the clip digs into my hand when writing. It is a shame because I love the Lamy 2000 fountain pen as much as a hate the ballpoint.

"BIC_609","2023-03-24","So, I actually did a comparison of as many blue oil-based ballpoint inks in 1.0mm that I could find (the RSVP was the only 0.7mm, cuz that's all I had on hand) and put them to the test. Let me see if I can find a picture...[Here it is](https://imgur.com/a/2eiLMJ4) And forgive me, I forgot add Easy and Quink Flows to this (it was a quick roundup, shoot me). So, the first picture is just how it came out normally, however, when I edited the photo and turned up the brightness what it reveals is that when it comes to saturation: Uni Jetstream was obviously the winner, but we knew it was going to be due to it being a hybrid, however, of the non-hybrids, it seems that BIC Glide (surprisingly) and Pen &amp; Gear (also surprisingly) were two of the best as far as saturation goes. You can look at the curly line and see how much darker they are than the others. Now, you might see the ""Z"" which is for the Z-Grip and its saturation falls short of the top 2, however, what you can't see is just how smooth they are and that's the tradeoff you get with a Z-Grip, at least when it comes to the color blue. Aside from the Jetstream, which is the smoothest of all, but was really only there as a control, the Z-Grip was the smothest non-hybrid. So there's a bit of a tradeoff and decision to make. Do you sacrifice smoothness for a bit more saturation or vice versa. I, personally, enjoy the smootheness of a pen more than I do the saturation, unless the pen is so inconsistent that it's bothersome, but a Z-Grip is consistent enough that smoothness trumps the rest. That being said Zebra is actually much more saturated with other colors than they are with blue. Blue just isn't Zebra's strong suit when it comes to inks, they managed to kill it with their purple and magenta though, both smooth **and** saturated.","actually comparison many blue oil-based ballpoint ink 1.0mm find rsvp 0.7mm cuz hand put test let see can find picture forgive forget add easy quink flow quick roundup shoot first picture just come normally however edit photo turn brightness reveal come saturation uni jetstream obviously winner know go due hybrid however non-hybrids seem bic glide surprisingly pen amp gear also surprisingly two good far saturation go can look curly line see much dark other now may see z z-grip saturation fall short top however see just smooth tradeoff get z-grip less come color blue aside jetstream smooth really control z-grip smothest non-hybrid bite tradeoff decision make sacrifice smoothness bite saturation vice versa personally enjoy smootheness pen saturation unless pen inconsistent bothersome z-grip consistent enough smoothness trump rest say zebra actually much saturate color blue blue just zebra's strong suit come ink manage kill purple magenta though smooth saturate",0.082514449738929,0.0700841436916139

Unless labeled as capless they need a cap to keep them from drying out. Ballpoints use oil-based ink. Classic Ballpoint uses thick paste ink. They have more rolling resistance and need more pressure. Hybrid Ballpoints use liquid ink that feels closer to a rollerball. Gel uses a thickened water-based ink. They tend to be smoother than other types. Most types of gel ink dry quickly and are less prone to smearing. Another category is Fineliners or micro felt-tipped pens/refills. Most use water-based liquid ink with a porous plastic or felt tip. They need almost zero pressure to write with. They can be very fragile and are damaged easily. They are available in Euro-type rollerball refill sizes for capped rollerball pens.

They're not as good in color or writing pressure as a gel ink, but they also lack the benefits of traditional ballpoint inks in that they will fade, they're not waterproof, and have trouble on glossy surfaces. What happens is that the oil and water components will separate. So the water (which is most of the ink) will wash away, but the oil will stay. They're advertised as the best of both worlds, but I've always found them to the worst of both.","personally never understand point hybrid ink like jetstream acroball good color write pressure gel ink also lack benefit traditional ballpoint ink fade waterproof trouble glossy surface happen oil water component separate water ink wash away oil stay advertise good world always find bad",-0.0798945731333959,0.0828110045496964

Thats how the idea came about: why not use a ball-shaped metal nib for writing? This is how the pen was born. =Â LÃ¡szlÃ³ JÃ³zsef Biro shared his idea with his brother GyÃ¶rgy, a chemist, and together they began researching and experimenting to create a new type of pen based on this concept. Finally, they found the perfect combination: a viscous ink and a tip with a small ball that rotated freely, preventing the ink from drying out and controlling its flow. They presented their invention at the Budapest International Fair in 1931 and patented it in 1938, although they did not market it immediately. With the start of World War II, the brothers emigrated to Argentina, where they founded a company in a garage. Although they were initially unsuccessful due to the high cost of the product, they secured a contract with the British Air Force, which boosted their popularity. In 1943, they licensed their invention to Eversharp Faber in the United States for $2 million. In 1950, Marcel Bich acquired the rights and, on the recommendation of an advertising expert, dropped the h from his surname and founded the company BICGroup. In that year, they launched the first BIC Cristal, one of the most perfect designs ever created, of which more than 20 million units are sold every day around the world. Since 1953, more than 100 billion BIC Cristals have been manufactured, making it the best-selling pen of all time. Interesting. Idk how true it is but this was found on Facebook.","hungarian inventor observe child play marble puddle notice marble leave trail water wake s idea come use ball-shaped metal nib write pen bear lÃ¡szlÃ³ jÃ³zsef biro share idea brother gyÃ¶rgy chemist together begin research experiment create new type pen base concept finally find perfect combination viscous ink tip small ball rotate freely prevent ink dry control flow present invention budapest international fair patent although market immediately start world war ii brother emigrate argentina found company garage although initially unsuccessful due high cost product secure contract british air force boost popularity license invention eversharp faber unite state million marcel bich acquire right recommendation advertise expert drop h surname found company bicgroup year launch first bic cristal one perfect design ever create million unit sell every day around world since billion bic cristals manufacture make best-selling pen time interest idk true find facebook",0.254964180562381,0.1206221147218
