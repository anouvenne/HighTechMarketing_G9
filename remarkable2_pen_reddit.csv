"Remarkable-2-8f7c9683ffcb38b9c7b0862f469682ae",2021-01-21,"Shorthand is a tool for fast handwritten notes. There are many systems and systems are for the most part based on a specific language. The basic idea (at least for the DEK that you see above) is that common building blocks of the language become represented by the set of letters. Also, speech is written as it is heard. In the DEK, Vowels are written by writing the other parts of the words closer or further apart and higher or lower than the baseline. And with growing abilities, very long phrases become very short (e.g. ""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren"" for ""Dear Ladies and Gentlemen"" can be written in roughly a second). Shorthand has become of less importance during the 20th century due to the rise of (electric) typewriters and computers. However, depending on the language and context, handwritten shorthand still exceeds the speed of writing on a keyboard by far. It is still being used for exact protocols in German parliaments, for instance.","Remarkable-2"

However, if you get a thinner nib stylus, like the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, (or Onyx Boox pen that comes with the Note Air... don't think you can purchase it separately yet) on the RM2 is really nice. It's got just about the right level of friction on the RM2 itself, and glides cleanly enough with the thinner nibs that it's close to a gel pen on paper. I can't comment on the Supernote as I haven't tried it, but from watching MyDeepGuide's initial unboxing of the A6X, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMEcDxNoBLg&amp;t=631s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMEcDxNoBLg&amp;t=631s)) it sounds like it will be really nice too.","Remarkable-2"

When I change pages the writing doesn't register, often, for 2 or 3 seconds. Never have had this issue on the RM1. The folio is useless, except for transport. magnetic attachment of the pen a gimmick and not practical. Attachment really only works ... in the folio. I'd never rely on magnetic attachment to secure the pen ... for transport. The slit along the pen edge ruins it for me. The form factor is ok, but I don't like the extra weight.

Another alternative I would put out there is Supernote A6X. I was also on the RM2 or not bandwagon but eventually went with the Supernote for the following reasons: * Don't have to replace Supernote's ceramic nibs and personally I was going for more a pen like experience vs a pencil one. * To this point I think Supernote is probably the only offering with hard nib/soft screen space (and I am absolutely loving it so far). * I am totally fine with a smaller A6 form factor, as my current daily notebooks are all that size and I find them much more portable. * And I have been really impressed with the Supernote team. They are very active on the sub-reddit and it's very easy to get their attention. * They also have been prolific in rolling out updates and have found them willing to share tentative timelines about upcoming features. But given all of this, I can totally see RM2 appealing to folks who care a lot about the writing experience, especially the pencil feel and would prioritize that higher than anything else.","Remarkable-2"

Please don't look for a more lasting stylus/nib, because what you're essentially looking for is a harder material. It's all very basic physics really.. Every material has a hardness, with every friction there is wear, the closer the two materially hardness, the more the wear gets distributed between both. You can scratch metal with metal, even with some plastics, but you can not scratch metal with chalk for instance. The nib wear is not a shortcoming, it's an engineered and thought through feature, to have the more easily replaceable and cheaper side of surfaces, involved in constant friction, to be much much softer, because you'd rather be changing the nib than the screen, right? With a harder nib, or some everlasting nib (it will not be instant ofcourse) you will start noticing subtle and then not so subtle scratches in the screen.","Remarkable-2"

Not sure how they might impact the ReMarkable screen, but they basically ruined two of my pens. One was the Lamy, and one was the gen 1 ReMarkable pen with the (pointless) click end. It stretched out the opening in the barrel where the nib sits on both of these, and now they barely hold onto the regular nibs I was using. The connection is very loose.

The only thing I have found is the nibs are slightly thicker than the official cardboard nibs and so needed a good bit of pressure to install in to my marker+ - I suspect it has widened the marker and may have affected the ability to go back to a normal nib again without it being a little loose. On the whole I'm pleased with the writing feel and it's more like writing with a roller ink pen now - with good accurate response on the screen. I'm glad I got the nibs.","Remarkable-2"
