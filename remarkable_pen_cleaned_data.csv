"RM_167","2023-12-27","The reMarkable OS has 49 templates preloaded. They come in 4 categories: creative, grids, life/organize, and lines. Lines and grids are pretty self explanatory. Creative templates are things like pages for musical notation or guitar chords/tablature, or isometric/perspective drawings, or calligraphy lines. The life/organize category has planner templates, storyboards, and checklists. Most people probably have their favorite 1-5 templates and just use those 90+% of the time. There are tons of free and not-free templates out there. Some are PDF based, while other hack the reMarkable to add to the 49 preloaded templates. There isnt a natively supported way to add templates, but tools like RCU make adding templates easy. I find the hacked versions to be more flexible. PDF templates are fine if you can happily work within a single file and dont need to add PDF template pages. reMarkable native and hacked templates can be added and moved anywhere without restriction, and are better if you want to quickly add any template anywhere, or switch templates on a page. Do you need to buy or add your own templates? It depends on how you use the reMarkable. How much repetitive structure do you need? 95% of what I do just needs lines, and I add the headings with different pens. But I have a health tracking pages that has the precise metrics I want to track, and I created a template with all the boxes I want to fill in weekly. I also have a special version of lined paper for my to-do lists and my work week, but lined paper would work pretty well for those too. I think the best approach is to start with lines and grids, and add templates as you find the need. One method for creating templates on the reMarkable is to use layers. You create a new layer that has the template labels, lines, boxes, etc. and then you write on the default layer. You can find videos on YouTube for this. So I wouldnt worry about templates too much. The reMarkable is very flexible and you have a lot of low to no-cost options.","remarkable os template preload come category creative grid life organize line line grid pretty self explanatory creative template thing like page musical notation guitar chord tablature isometric perspective drawing calligraphy line life organize category planner template storyboards checklist people probably favorite 1-5 template just use time ton free not-free template pdf base hack remarkable add preload template isn t natively support way add template tool like rcu make add template easy find hack version flexible pdf template fine can happily work within single file don t need add pdf template page remarkable native hack template can add move anywhere without restriction good want quickly add template anywhere switch template page need buy add template depend use remarkable much repetitive structure need just need line add heading different pen health track page precise metric want track create template box want fill weekly also special version line paper to-do list work week line paper work pretty good think good approach start line grid add template find need one method create template remarkable use layer create new layer template label line box etc write default layer can find video youtube wouldn t worry template much remarkable flexible lot low no-cost option",0.201957995523942,0.144349147424708

"RM_197","2023-11-08","If you've been through three styluses, I'm leaning in the direction of your heavy hand doing damage to your pens. If you've used titanium nibs in all of them, then your heavy hand could be jamming the nibs too far into and damaging the recessed end of the nib silo which causes your problem. That said, the pens aren't weak. Your issue is pretty individual, and you'll likely do the same damage to any pen you use.

If you're putting enough pressure on the pen to damage its internal components, you're also going to eventually damage your screen using the harder nibs if you haven't damaged it already.

"RM_410","2024-09-08","Hi. My 2 cents. I tried a long time on finding the perfect app on the iPad (Pro, Mini etc.). Then I tried writing on the glass of an iPad and it is not OK.

"RM_449","2022-10-07","I feel like I'm very late with this response. But here's my 2 cents that I want to add: Check out the iReader marker x-pen3 and the iReader x pen. They are 2 very different pens. The iReader x Pen3 is very similar to the remarkable marker. It has the same length and weight to it and their eraser works out of the box, without need for the hacks. It also has a good strong magnet, so it will work very well with the Remarkable. The feel is not rubbery, but more plastic, but due to it's heft, it doesn't feel cheap at all. The iReader X pen, is a bit smaller and comes with a more fine tip. No eraser. But has a pocket clip. It is made from metal and the top can be unscrewed to store 2 additional tips. The tips themselves are softer, more like the black ones you get with the Samsung stylus, but have a bit more drag / resistance to them then Samsung tips. Speaking of tips, the iReader x pen 3 comes with similar tips as the ones you can get with the Remarkable. But in my opinion they last longer and have more drag to them as well, which gives is a better writing sensation. Even if you don't get their pens, I recommend trying out their nibs as they feel way better than the Remarkable and Samsung nib replacements. Right now, I use the iReader thick nibs (from the x pen 3) on my Lamy, Samsung stylus and the iReader pen. I tend to alternate between the 3, depending on how I feel. Also, if you guys prefer the sensitivity of Samsung stylus, but find it that they are too thin, Amazon and eBay sell silicone sleeves that give it a bit more thickness. I find those very pleasant to use. Cheers. &amp;#x200B; P.S.

Its much harder and more precise than the Remarkable nibs, so it has more of a pen-on-paper than pencil-on-paper feel.

However, if you get a thinner nib stylus, like the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, (or Onyx Boox pen that comes with the Note Air... don't think you can purchase it separately yet) on the RM2 is really nice. It's got just about the right level of friction on the RM2 itself, and glides cleanly enough with the thinner nibs that it's close to a gel pen on paper.

As part of my job, we are allowed to expense self development books and I have several ebooks that I was using my iPad to read on. To get the ebooks on my rmpp, I just googled how to turn the ebook file into a pdf and found a website that does it flawlessly. Once converted, I just dropped them in my desktop app and now theyre on my rmpp. I can make notes or highlight sections in the books with no problems. I love the size and writing experience on it. There are plenty of templates on the rmpp, but I purchased some that were more for my needs. When traveling, I still take my iPad and computer in my backpack, but the rmpp is so light its not noticeable.","ii rmpp travel lot work good completely satisfy far part job allow expense self development book several ebooks use ipad read get ebooks rmpp just googled turn ebook file pdf find website flawlessly convert just drop desktop app now re rmpp can make note highlight section book problem love size write experience plenty template rmpp purchase need travel still take ipad computer backpack rmpp light s noticeable",0.203973046280929,0.094707099835921

Poor customers service, subscription plans, expensive pens, and a wonky interface that limits basic functions are all holding back the potential for this product. Now, are you going to pipe in and give me the 'contact customer support' with a link?

"RM_737","2024-04-05","The industry I work in (education) is constantly asking about my Remarkable. Every single person loves it , especially when I let them use it themselves. The one thing that stops them in their tracks is the price. Then I tell them the price of just the pen... then about the subscription... then the pen tips that you need... It sounds like a rip off. These are people who don't work in offices but their job requires lots of note taking, as of now their only option is carrying a clunky laptop. The potential is there for a huge market for college kids, younger students. Heck, I would have bought mine 3 years ago if it hadn't cost so much. I think a lot of people feel that way. I guess I have more confidence in the concept and the public's need than you. And if the company never expands or improves it will die out, especially with tech.","industry work education constantly ask remarkable every single person love especially let use one thing stop track price tell price just pen subscription pen tip need sound like rip people work office job require lot note take now option carry clunky laptop potential huge market college kid young student heck buy mine year ago cost much think lot people feel way guess confidence concept public's need company never expand improve die especially tech",0.00747171903346486,0.120056901402432
"RM_738","2024-04-05","Yes, the potential market is huge  anyone who writes. The actual demand is very very low. Again, its an excellent product but the alternatives (laptop, phone, pen and paper) are very compelling because theyre something everyone already has and carries with them. And remember not to confuse interest in a product w/ intent to buy it. A classic sales mistake. Oh I would totally buy that if it was cheaper is just expressed interest. Cut the price in half (or whatever) and 90% of those people who were excited about it suddenly find another excuse.","yes potential market huge anyone write actual demand low s excellent product alternative laptop phone pen paper compel re something everyone already carry remember confuse interest product w intent buy classic sale mistake oh totally buy cheap just express interest cut price half whatever people excite suddenly find another excuse",0.081254243104684,0.116750605530951
