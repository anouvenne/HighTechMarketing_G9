Im hoping someone out there may see this and be able to answer. I owned a Starwriter pen that Id stopped using when I started using my reMarkable2. I really missed using it. Fast forward to recently when I found (here) this option. I found an MB13389 on eBay, and its GREAT. However, I know Im going to burn through nibs. The montblanc website had one left in stock  so I ordered it: https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/replacement-tips_cod18706561955721947.html Now Im getting anxious I will have an amazing pen I love to use (again) but no way to replace the consumable bits.

"Remarkable-2-a9a4480a3664c7b563118e841c56be86",2022-01-29,"&gt;I had a Pebble watch and was really upset when they got sold out and their servers were shut down. Yes, some people hacked together a solution, but it wasn't nearly as functional or stable. A lot of tech these days depends on company servers staying up. Quite a few smart bulbs and locks won't work if the company goes out of business. This happens with video games too. It's hard to spend so much money on a bunch of stuff that may not work in the (potentially near) future. That's the whole reason I'm not getting a Glowforge. I don't want a $3000 paperweight. It sounds like the functionality of the ReMarkable won't go away if they do go out of business, which was definitely a consideration when I purchased mine.","Remarkable-2"

Another alternative I would put out there is Supernote A6X. I was also on the RM2 or not bandwagon but eventually went with the Supernote for the following reasons: * Don't have to replace Supernote's ceramic nibs and personally I was going for more a pen like experience vs a pencil one. * To this point I think Supernote is probably the only offering with hard nib/soft screen space (and I am absolutely loving it so far). * I am totally fine with a smaller A6 form factor, as my current daily notebooks are all that size and I find them much more portable. * And I have been really impressed with the Supernote team. They are very active on the sub-reddit and it's very easy to get their attention. * They also have been prolific in rolling out updates and have found them willing to share tentative timelines about upcoming features.

"Remarkable-2-d5a480c682048411a62a6833b6f8c582",2023-12-27,"The reMarkable OS has 49 templates preloaded. They come in 4 categories: creative, grids, life/organize, and lines. Lines and grids are pretty self explanatory. Creative templates are things like pages for musical notation or guitar chords/tablature, or isometric/perspective drawings, or calligraphy lines. The life/organize category has planner templates, storyboards, and checklists. Most people probably have their favorite 1-5 templates and just use those 90+% of the time. There are tons of free and not-free templates out there. Some are PDF based, while other hack the reMarkable to add to the 49 preloaded templates. There isnt a natively supported way to add templates, but tools like RCU make adding templates easy. I find the hacked versions to be more flexible. PDF templates are fine if you can happily work within a single file and dont need to add PDF template pages. reMarkable native and hacked templates can be added and moved anywhere without restriction, and are better if you want to quickly add any template anywhere, or switch templates on a page. Do you need to buy or add your own templates? It depends on how you use the reMarkable. How much repetitive structure do you need? 95% of what I do just needs lines, and I add the headings with different pens. But I have a health tracking pages that has the precise metrics I want to track, and I created a template with all the boxes I want to fill in weekly. I also have a special version of lined paper for my to-do lists and my work week, but lined paper would work pretty well for those too. I think the best approach is to start with lines and grids, and add templates as you find the need. One method for creating templates on the reMarkable is to use layers. You create a new layer that has the template labels, lines, boxes, etc. and then you write on the default layer. You can find videos on YouTube for this. So I wouldnt worry about templates too much. The reMarkable is very flexible and you have a lot of low to no-cost options.","Remarkable-2"

In particular: - the fact that you cannot access your email or a web browser (which is quite convenient to get or send files) - the fact that you can on an onyx boox set custom pens (color, width, style) that you can change with one click (eg one pen for titles or important results, one for normal text, one for small comments...). On the rM you have to change each feature one by one each time. He finally bought a lumi max which enabled him two things which I am quite jealous of : - a split screen: one screen with an article, the other with the notebook with the article notes (I have to switch between the two with my rM which can be done in one gesture with an hack but I still can't see both at the same time) - use overleaf with a bluetooth keyboard.

If you've used titanium nibs in all of them, then your heavy hand could be jamming the nibs too far into and damaging the recessed end of the nib silo which causes your problem. That said, the pens aren't weak. Your issue is pretty individual, and you'll likely do the same damage to any pen you use. What I suggest therefore is that you buy cheaper pens and don't use titanium. If you're putting enough pressure on the pen to damage its internal components, you're also going to eventually damage your screen using the harder nibs if you haven't damaged it already. A couple less expensive options on Amazon below.

Notebook templates are PNG files, and PDFs (using them as templates) are uploaded via RCU, duplicate, rename, then use. Not quite the same. But some of the automation of a PDF works such as links to the other pages in the PDF for easier nav. (Wish the ebooks had this.) To upload a custom notebook template, the einkpads templater installer is very useful. There are manual ways of doing it if you want to go that route. [Einkpads.com](https://Einkpads.com) has some pretty nice templates to consider. There is are questionable means to get your Kindle books installed. They work but Google is your friend. If you don't have the Marker Plus, take a look at the STAEDTLER Noris digital jumbo 180J 22. EMR Stylus with a soft digital eraser. It's a fourth of the cost. More like a gel pen as far as feel, but with an eraser that works without pressing any buttons. If you have the Marker Plus, still consider the STAEDTLER Noris digital jumbo 180J 22. EMR Stylus with the soft digital eraser to use while you are at the coffee shop. Lost that and you are only out $36 as opposed to $129 plus shipping and waiting.

"Remarkable-2-de5a9f11c2aed1cc9b9d12bcea7aa45c",2022-10-07,"I feel like I'm very late with this response. But here's my 2 cents that I want to add: Check out the iReader marker x-pen3 and the iReader x pen. They are 2 very different pens. The iReader x Pen3 is very similar to the remarkable marker. It has the same length and weight to it and their eraser works out of the box, without need for the hacks. It also has a good strong magnet, so it will work very well with the Remarkable. The feel is not rubbery, but more plastic, but due to it's heft, it doesn't feel cheap at all. The iReader X pen, is a bit smaller and comes with a more fine tip. No eraser. But has a pocket clip. It is made from metal and the top can be unscrewed to store 2 additional tips. The tips themselves are softer, more like the black ones you get with the Samsung stylus, but have a bit more drag / resistance to them then Samsung tips. Speaking of tips, the iReader x pen 3 comes with similar tips as the ones you can get with the Remarkable. But in my opinion they last longer and have more drag to them as well, which gives is a better writing sensation. Even if you don't get their pens, I recommend trying out their nibs as they feel way better than the Remarkable and Samsung nib replacements. Right now, I use the iReader thick nibs (from the x pen 3) on my Lamy, Samsung stylus and the iReader pen. I tend to alternate between the 3, depending on how I feel. Also, if you guys prefer the sensitivity of Samsung stylus, but find it that they are too thin, Amazon and eBay sell silicone sleeves that give it a bit more thickness. I find those very pleasant to use. Cheers. &amp;#x200B; P.S. Here's the link to their site in case anyone is interested: https://findereader.com/collections/stylus","Remarkable-2"

The pen itself was a bit of a letdown&quality feels great but its too small for my hands, so my fingers cramp up pretty quickly. Im coming from the Marker Plus, and actually miss the eraser way more than I thought I would. The menu is just so aggravating to navigate every time you need it. However, the white nib is FANTASTIC, and I use it full time in my marker now (the nibs are interchangeable between the two). Its much harder and more precise than the Remarkable nibs, so it has more of a pen-on-paper than pencil-on-paper feel. It feels more precise to use, like I can actually tell where on the screen the nib is landing, and actually helps with some of my complaints about screen accuracy. So if you have a tight grip or large hand, or really love the Remarkable nibs, I wouldnt recommend. If you can buy the nibs separately, thats definitely what I would have done, had I known what I know now.","Remarkable-2"
